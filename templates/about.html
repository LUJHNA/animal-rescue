                <p class="card-text">
                    At Jakob's Animal Rescue, we believe every animal deserves a loving home. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, 
                    and rehome abandoned, abused, and neglected animals. We are dedicated to creating a community where 
                    animals are valued, protected, and loved.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Animal Rescue was founded in 2025 by a man named Jakob. Jakob is a passionate animal lover who saw the need for a dedicated 
                    rescue organization in Copenhagen and the surrounding regions. Starting just by himself and his small rented animal foster home, he has 
                    grown to become one of the region's leading animal welfare organizations with several dedicated employees and locations.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Already since we started at the beginning of this year, we have rescued and rehomed over 300 animals, providing them with medical care, 
                    behavioral training, and loving temporary homes until they find their forever families.
